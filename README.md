# Godot_UI
Application created while learning Godot and C#.
It uses UI elements like buttons, labels, line edits, panels, box containers available in Godot.
To make the app more interesting, I implemented capacitor charging model. 
Output from the model is being updated as time flows to simulate the process of charging capacitor.
